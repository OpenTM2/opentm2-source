*
* INFORMATION: Place an asterisk (*) before any of the following switches to disable the output creation.
*
* =============================================================================================================
* == PURPOSE: Switch to globally activate the MT-logging in the Translation Environment. ======================
MTLOGGING
*
*
* =============================================================================================================
* == PURPOSE: Switch to add word count information to all XML and EXP output files.      ======================
*INCLUDEWORDCOUNT
*
* Note: In the EXP formats the word count info is stored in the AddData section of each segment and the total 
*       word count is stored in the description field of the EXP file.
*       In the XML formats the word count is stored in words= attribute of the <s> elements and the total word
*       count is stored in the <totalWords> element. 
*
* =============================================================================================================
* == PURPOSE: Switch to create an XML-file which contains ALL source-segments but NO exact matches.          == 
NOMATCH
*
*
* PURPOSE: Same output as NOMATCH but without duplicate segments                                             == 
*NOMATCH_NODUPLICATE
*
* Note: Only one of the switches NOMATCH and NOMATCH_NODUPLICATE can be active at a time   
*
* =============================================================================================================
*
* =============================================================================================================
* == PURPOSE: Switch to create an EXP-file which contains ALL source-segments but NO exact matches.          ==

*
* PURPOSE: Same output as NOMATCHEXP but without duplicate segments                                          ==

*
* Note: Only one of the switches NOMATCHEXP and NOMATCHEXP_NODUPLICATE can be active at a time   
*
* =============================================================================================================
*
* =============================================================================================================
* == PURPOSE: Switch to create an XML-file which contains ALL source-segments EVEN exact matches.            == 
*ALLSEGS
*
* PURPOSE: Same output as ALLSEGS but without duplicate segments                                             ==

* =============================================================================================================
* == PURPOSE: Switch to create an XML-file which contains ALL source-segments and ALL target-segments        ==
* ==          including e.g. EXACT or FUZZY matches. In addition the MATCH-rate is written into the output.  == 
*ALLWMATCH
*
* PURPOSE: Same output as ALLWMATCH but without duplicate segments                                            ==

* ==          translation memory proposal is written into the output.                                        == 
* ALLWMATCHSOURCE
*
* PURPOSE: Same output as ALLWMATCHSOURCE but without duplicate segments                                     ==

*
* =============================================================================================================
*
* =============================================================================================================
* == PURPOSE: Switch to create an XML-file which contains ALL source-segments which have no proposal at all  ==
*             also ignoring FUZZY matches with a fuzziness below 50%.                                        == 
*NOPROPOSAL
*
* PURPOSE: Same output as NOPROPOSAL but without duplicate segments                                          ==
