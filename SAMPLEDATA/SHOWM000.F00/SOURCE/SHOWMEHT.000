<P><B>Welcome to a short introduction to the capabilities of OpenTM2. </B> </P>
<P></P>
<P>Usually a translator has to translate each sentence anew, even if the same sentence was already translated several days ago. </P>
<P></P>
<P>OpenTM2 provides dictionary proposals that help you to translate the sentence. </P>
<P></P>
<P>OpenTM2 also provides an integrated translation memory containing all previously translated sentences. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Using translation proposals offered by OpenTM2 makes your translations more consistent. </P>
