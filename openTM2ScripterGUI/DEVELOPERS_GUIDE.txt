This guide shall explain you the structure of the project, so new developers will have an easy start.

The project-root ("/"):
----------------------
Important in this directory are the files "configuration.conf" and "log.txt".
Also, the "resources/" directory, that includes such things as icons, and other information the project uses.
If you create a jar-package of this project, do not forget to deliver them with your package.
Also we have additional Java packages (such as antlr, miglayout,...) in the "libs/" directory. 
If you need to include further external libraries, please put them in this directory.
Last, but not least, the "src/" directory contains all source code of the project.

The resources-directory ("/resources/"):
----------------------------------------
There is a subdirectory "icons/" with all icons used in the project.
Further more, there are the files "commands.xml", "EQFFUNC.h" and "parseApiCalls.py".
For the running application only "commands.xml" is important, as this is the source for the application
to know which commands/apicalls/blocks exist in the ScriptLanguage.
As the api calls in the "commands.xml" directly depend on openTM2 there is one of the header files of openTM2.
You can use the script "parseApiCalls.py" to parse this, or a newer version, of "EQFFUNC.h" and update the content of
"commands.xml". Simpy call "./parseApiCall.py commands.xml EQFFUNC.h" and it will update the content of "commands.xml".

The src-directory ("/src/"):
---------------------------
Through many subdirectories you will end up in the directory "/src/de/ibm/com/opentm2scripteride/" where you can find 
four subdirectories to which I will refer later on.
Also in this root-source-directory you will find "MainApp.java" which provides the main class and the system entry point
(main function) of this application.

NOTE:
This project makes use of the "Singleton" pattern. If you don't know it, please learn first what it is and why it is used.
In this project all classes that may only exist once and must be globally accessible are written as a Singleton class.


The gui-directory ("/src/[...]/gui"):
-------------------------------------
In this directory you will find all windows the application needs. These windows are designed with WindowBuilder, a free
plugin for Eclipse to build a GUI easily.
