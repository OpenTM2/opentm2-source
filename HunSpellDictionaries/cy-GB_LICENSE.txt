1. Introduction

The Welsh MySpell dictionaries have been developed by the Language,
Technologies Unit Bangor University and are based on the same extensive 
word lists used in the production of their own Welsh spelling and grammar 
checking software Cysill and the Microsoft Office XP,2003 and 2007 Welsh 
proofing tools.

The dictionary is an affix compression from an original word list that
contains over a million entries of root words in their various abbreviated, 
mutated, conjugated etc. forms.

The dictionary supports special Welsh characters such as w circumflex 
(w to bach) and y circumflexed (y to bach) if used within OpenOffice.org 1.1 
release onwards.
