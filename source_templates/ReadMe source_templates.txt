	  The files in this directory should be used as templates when creating
new files in OpenTM2.

Their purpose are to ensure that
   - each file contains the correct copyright-statement
   - each file contains a DoxyGen-header which fits into the process
     of documentation-creation for OpenTM2.

There are templates for the following types of files:
- Makefiles (*.MAK)                    ==> makefile.header
- C/C++ Source-files (*.c, *.cpp)      ==> c.header
- C/C++ Include-files (*.h, *.hpp)     ==> h.header

The appropriate template should be copied to the beginning of the new file.
