    <p><b><u>Prerequisites</u></b>: <b>MySQL</b> and the Web Service Server are started.      
      <note>By starting the <q>OtmTMService.jar</q>, MySQL is automatically started too. So no manual start of 
            this component is usually required.</note>
    </p>
    <p>Translators can connect to a Web-based Shared Translation Memory as soon as these users are defined in the user 
       access list of this Web-based Shared Translation Memory. After having successfully connected to the 
       Web-based Shared Translation Memory, a copy of the Web-based Shared Translation Memory is stored on the local 
       <keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/tm4w"/> client installation. This is a way to share translation 
       memories created by other users. Users work with this translation memory almost identically as they work with any 
       other local translation memory created by the user. The only exception is that users, not being the creator of the 
       shared translation memory, can not delete it on the shared translation memory server.
    </p>
    <p>In order to connect to the Web-based Shared Translaiton Memory, follow these steps:
      <ul>
        <li>In <keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/tm4w"/>, right-mouse click into the translation memory list window.</li>
        <li>From the context menu select <q>Connect Shared Resourceâ€¦</q>.</li>
        <li>The panel <q>Options to connect to a shared memory</q> opens.</li>
        <li><b>Type in</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>The <q>Service URL</q> which is the URL of the web service (e.g. http://localhost:8085/tmservice). 
                Ensure to add your server&quot;s real IP-address to the field <q>Service URL</q> (<q>Localhost</q> is only an example).</li>
            <li>The <q>User ID</q> which is the client user ID to access the shared translation memory (e.g. <q>xyz</q>).</li>
            <li>The <q>Password</q> which belongs to the <q>User ID</q>.</li>
            <li>Click on the button <q>OK</q>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The panel <q>Connect Shared Translation Memory databases</q> appears. From the left hand side pane <q>Available</q>, 
            select (click on it) the translation memory you want to connect to, and then press the button <q>Add-&gt;&gt;</q>. 
            From the right-hand pane <q>Selected</q> choose the shared translation memory you want to connect to (e.g. M009), 
            and click on the button <q>Connect</q>.
