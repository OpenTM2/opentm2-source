    <p>The panel <q><keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/tm4w"/> Memory Replicator</q> supports a 
       <q>real time memory replication</q> with the server. In the left hand <q>Available</q> window all existing 
       memories are listed, but they are <b>not</b> actively replicated with the server. You can select the memory you want 
       to replicate, and move it to the <q>Selected</q> list window on the right-hand side. After having moved one or more 
       translation memories to the <q>Selected</q> list window, the memories automatically start to be synchronized with server.
       This means, that the segments of the <b>local</b> translation memory are uploaded to server, and that segments 
       of the WEB-based Translation Memory are download to the client.</p>

    <p>If you don&apos;t want a memory to be synchronized with the server, you can just move it from <q>Selected</q> to the 
       <q>Available</q> list window.</p> 
    <p>The <q>Replication interval</q> (in seconds) can be adjusted. The bigger the interval for memory replication 
       is defined, the longer it takes to synchronize the local translation memory with the server translation memory. 
       So it is better to set the <q>Replication interval</q> between 5 to 15 seconds. But there is no general rule â€“ 
       observe the systems behaviour, and set the interval-time to a value where your infrastructure is supported the best.</p>
