    <p>The function <b>Concordance search</b> allows to search through one or more Translation Memory databases for terms. This function is 
      useful to search for other translations of the given term or to verify the context of translations.</p>
    <p>The concordance search is activated from the <b>Edit</b> pulldown menu of the Translation Environment.</p>
    <p>The concordance search window is a modeless window which can be opened parallel to the other windows of the Translation Environment; 
      i.e. you can work in the translation window without having to close the concordance search window.</p>
    <p>The window can be positioned everywhere on the desktop and its size is customizable.</p>
