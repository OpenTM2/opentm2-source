<p>You can position and size all subsidiary windows on the Workbench
as you find them most convenient. When the Workbench is displayed
for the first time, <keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/tm4w"/> has made a default arrangement
for you.</p>
<p>The defaults are usually good choices for many translators, but
you are free to rearrange and resize the windows into whatever position
and size you like.</p>
<p>The window layout can best be determined by you according to your
requirements and preferences. For example, have the windows positioned
in a tiled way, overlaying each other, displayed as icons, or hidden
behind other windows to reduce clutter on the screen.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is by placing the mouse pointer in the
windowâ€™s title bar and dragging the window into the new position.
This is a basic function of the operating system you use. If you do
not know how to reposition or resize windows, refer to the appropriate
user documentation of your operating system.</p>
