      <p>The main purpose of exporting a folder is to make documents available to other users 
         or on other systems. Other translation material, such as dictionaries and 
         <keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/xlmems"/>, can also be exported, 
         either as part of a folder, or separately.</p>
      <p>Exporting a folder is the easiest way of distributing translated material from one 
         <keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/tm4w"/> user to another, and it is 
         the recommended way.</p>
      <p>You can also include a note for the recipient. This note could, for example, include
         instructions about which document to translate first or when the translation is due. 
         The recipient can display this note when importing the folder.</p>
      <p>You can also export the folder as a XLIFF <q>package</q> to allow translation
         outside of <keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/tm4w"/>. The export as an 
         XLIFF-folder only exports the <b>translatable parts</b> of the documents together with matching memory
         proposals. As not all parts of the documents are contained in the XLIFF-Folder, it can <b>not</b> be
         used to transport or backup an <keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/tm4w"/> folder. 
         XLIFF-folders can only be imported into the <keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/tm4w"/> 
         folder from which they had been exported from. If the <b>search translation memories</b> should be 
         exported too, the option <q>With search Translation Memory databases</q> in the tab <q>Options</q> 
         needs to be selected.</p>

          <pt>Export using folder short name</pt>
          <pd>To export the folder using a <b>short</b> name. This is useful if you later want to import
              the folder into a system that recognizes only file names with a length of eight characters

          <pt>Export in non-Unicode format</pt>
          <pd>This option exports the folder in a format which is compatible to TP5.5.1 and TP5.4
              (non-Unicode versions of TM). Older versions of 
              <keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/tm4w"/> can not use folders exported 
              in non-Unicode format due to changes in the file structure. If you use this option the
              segmented files, contained dictionaries and memories are converted to ASCII and stored
              in TP5.5.1 format.If you import a folder which is in non-Unicode format you will need to
              organize the contained memories and dictionaries after the import is completed to be
              able to use them.</pd>
        </plentry>

        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>Delete the folder after export</pt>
          <pd>To delete the folder <b>after</b> it is exported. This option can only be selected when all
              documents in the folder are being exported. After the export file is created, the system
              prompts you to confirm that you want to delete the folder. If you selected the <b>Select
              subfolders and documents to be exported</b> option, the <b>Select documents by translator</b> 
              option, or both, not all documents are exported, and the folder can not be deleted.</pd>

        <plentry id="expmasterfoldas">
          <pt>Export as master folder</pt>
          <pd>To export the folder as master folder. This option can be used to create a backup of a
              master folder or to move a master folder to another PC. If you export a master
              folder <b>without</b> specifying this option, the folder will be exported as a <b>child
