      <p>When translations are prepared centrally before being distributed to individual
        translators, you are strongly recommended to use folders as the means of distributing this
        material, because all related translation material (documents, dictionaries, and <keyword
          conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/xlmems"/>) can be included in one folder.</p>
      <p>Before you can start to work with material that has been exported, you must import the
        material in <keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/tm4w"/>.</p>
      <p>A folder exported to a diskette drive can span more than one diskette. The system prompts
        you to insert the diskettes into the diskette drive in the same sequence they were used
        during export.</p>

      <p>The folder is imported. It is added in the <q>Folder List</q> window, and you can start
        using its contents or the imported dictionaries for document analysis.</p>
      <p>If the folder contains a dictionary with the same name as an existing one, you
        are asked whether the dictionary is to be ignored, or to be imported and automatically
        merged with the existing one.</p>
      <p>If the folder contains a <keyword
          conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/xlmem"/> with the same name as an existing one,
        you are asked whether the <keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/xlmem"/> is to
        be ignored, or to be imported and automatically merged with the existing one.</p>
      <p>An imported folder also contains the markup tables of the folder and document properties.
        During import, markup tables in your system are overwritten if they have the same name and
        the markup table in the folder is a more recent one.</p>
      <p>If you import a folder that already exists but the content of one or more of its
        documents differs from the existing ones, the <q>Set Document Processing Options</q> window
        is displayed. You can then decide for each document whether it is to be imported.</p>
      <p>When you open the imported folder, the <q>Document List</q> window displays the details
        arrangement defined by the sender.</p>
