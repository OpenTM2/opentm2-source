    <p>When you open an Arabic document, you recognize the usual <q>Translation</q> window, <q>Dictionary</q> window, and 
      <q>Translation Memory</q> window. However, the contents of these windows look different in several aspects. The following 
      Translation Environment example assumes a translation from English to Arabic:</p>

            <indexterm>Arabic language<indexterm>reading order</indexterm><indexterm>text alignment</indexterm></indexterm>In the
            <q>Translation</q> window the text is aligned to the right, and the ruler runs from right to the left (ruler digits are always 
          shown as Latin digits). The reading order is from right to the left for English and Arabic words. While you are typing, the cursor
          moves from right to the left. The cursor control keys let the cursor move as depicted on the keys.</li>
        <li>In the <q>Dictionary</q> window all words are aligned to the left. The reading order of English words is from left to the right, 
          and the reading order of Arabic words is from right to the left.</li>
        <li>In the <q>Translation Memory</q> window the English source text is aligned to the left, and its reading order is from left to the 
          right. The Arabic translation proposals are aligned to the right, and their reading order is from right to the left (same alignment
          and reading order as in the <q>Translation</q> window).</li>

          <indexterm>shaping<indexterm>of Arabic characters</indexterm></indexterm>Shaping of Arabic characters is supported. (Arabic characters 
          can assume up to four different shapes depending on their positions in words and their connectivity traits of the surrounding 
          characters. The proper shape is selected by a shape-determination routine.)</li>

          <indexterm>ligating<indexterm>of Arabic characters</indexterm></indexterm>Ligatures of Arabic characters are supported.
          (A ligature is a graphic character consisting of two or more characters that are joined together. For example, the joining A and E 
          form the ligature Ã†.)</li>
        <li>Digits in the proposal window are displayed as Latin digits.</li>
        <li>The <b>Find and Replace</b> function in the Translation Environment allows you to select the <b>Case Respect</b> or <b>Case Ignore</b> 
          option. However, these options have no effect with Arabic language documents.</li>
