      <p>If you have <i><keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/xlmems"/></i> available
        from previous translations, you have several options: <ul>
          <li><keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/tm4w"/> can search existing
              <keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/xlmems"/> for segments that match
            segments in the document to be analyzed. Segments that match exactly or almost exactly
            can be copied into a new document- or project-specific <keyword
              conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/xlmem"/>.</li>
          <li>The system can perform automatic substitutions, that is, it copies the translations of
            segments that were previously made for an identical source segment (<i>exact match</i>)
            into the translation version of the document. Matches are considered to be exact even if
            the tagging of the segment to be replaced differs from that of the translation
            proposal.</li>
          <li>The remaining untranslated segments can optionally be send to the machine translation
            server. (only if the target language is supported by the machine translation
            server)</li>

          <pd>Select this option if the search for memory segments should stop at the first memory
            containing an exact match. This avoids duplicate exact matches from subsequent
            Translation Memory databases in the list. Without this option <keyword

        <plentry>
          <pt>Respect CRLF in segment</pt>
          <pd>The Translation Memory may contain two matching target segments for a source segment,
            one with carriage return line feed (CRLF), and one without. If you select this option,
            the target segment containing CRLF is taken during automatic substitution.</pd>

        <plentry>
          <pt>No blank at segment end even if source segment has one</pt>
          <pd>A source segment may differ from its matching target segment in that the source
            segment contains one or more blanks at its end. If you select this option, such segments
            are considered an exact match during automatic substitution and the additional blanks at
            the end of the source segment are removed.</pd>

        <plentry>
          <pt>Use joined segments when found</pt>
          <pd>Select this option to join segments. This can be useful if you want to analyze a
            document that you have worked with before and where you joined neighboring text segments
            before you translated them. During a new analysis run these segments are treated as
            separate units again. However, in the associated Translation Memory there is a match
            (translation) for the joined segments only. To find this match more easily during
            automatic substitution, this option joins neighboring segments in the document to be
            analyzed. Note that two neighboring segments are only joined if for the first segment in
            the sequence a fuzzy match has been found.</pd>

        <plentry>
          <pt>Ignore path in document names</pt>

            a document is checked for exact-exact matches. </pd>

        <plentry>
          <pt>No substitution if source and target segment is identical</pt>
          <pd>Select this option to suppress the automatic substitution of segments when the source
            segment is identical with the target segment found in the <keyword
              conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/xlmem"/>.</pd>

        <plentry id="ignorememoryproposalswithcomments">
          <pt>Ignore memory proposals with comments</pt>
          <pd>Select this option to suppress the automatic substitution of segments when the memory

        <plentry>
          <pt>Use TMO replacement list for IDDOC to DITA converted projects</pt>
          <pd>Select this option to specify a TMO replacement list to be applied on IDDOC proposals
            for DITA documents. Once this option is selected, the name of the replacement list can
            be typed in the list name field or be selected using the <b>Select....</b> button</pd>

      <p>When you select both <b>Use exact context match...</b> and <b>Use latest exact
        match...</b>, the system combines both requirements and chooses the latest of the exact
        context matches. You then get fewer automatic substitutions than with <b>Use latest exact
          match...</b> but more than with <b>Use exact context match...</b>.</p>
      <p>Click <b>Analyze</b> to begin with the analysis of the document. As it can take some time
        to analyze the document, a window is displayed showing the progress of the operation.</p>
