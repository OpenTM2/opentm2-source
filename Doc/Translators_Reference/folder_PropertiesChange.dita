      <p>When you create a folder, you must define its properties before you can work with the
         folder. Some of them can be changed later.</p>
      <p>The properties defined for each folder apply to all documents in the folder unless
         individual document properties have been set. It is sometimes not advisable to change the
         properties of a folder. In particular, you should not change the 
         <keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/xlmem"/> associated with the folder when you
        have started translating a document. You can change the associated dictionaries, if necessary. </p>

      <title>Options and parameters</title>
      <p>On the <q>Properties </q> page, the selected properties are shown in the
        respective fields. The <b>Name</b> field and the <b>Short name</b> field cannot be changed
        for an existing folder. </p>
      <p>The following fields contain the currently assigned names. They can be changed by selecting
        another name from the respective list box. <ul>
          <li><keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/xlmem"/></li>
          <li>Markup</li>
          <li>Editor</li>
          <li>Source language</li>
          <li>Target language</li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>For the <keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/xlmem"/> to be used, you can
        also type a new name in the respective field.
      </p>
      <p>The dictionaries to be used in the folder are selected as follows: 
        <ul>
          <li>The <b>Dictionaries to be searched</b> list box shows the selected dictionaries.</li>
          <li>To select or deselect dictionaries press the <b>Select...</b> button, which will open
            the dictionary selection window.</li>
          <li>Dictionaries can also be deselected by double-clicking the dictionary name.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The PID (Product Identifier) to be used in the folder is selected as follows: 
        <ul>
          <li>The PID selection is <b>only</b> available for the <b>entire folder</b>.</li>
          <li>In the folder property window, there is a field under the list of selected memories: 
            [PID selection:] [the value] [Select...]. The default is that there is no value, which means that 
            all dictionary entries are to be used, regardless of the PID value. If the button  <q>Select...</q> 
            is pressed, then a list of all the PID-values used in any of the selected dictionaries would be listed. 
            Users can select one or more of these listed values.</li>
          <li>Within the editor, when the dictionary entries are being shown, only the entries which have a 
            matching PID value or which have no PID values are shown in the Dictionary window.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The <keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/xlmems"/> to be
        searched in the folder are selected as follows: 
        <ul>
          <li>The <b><keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/xlmems"/></b> list box
            shows the selected Translation Memory databases.</li>
          <li>To select or deselect Translation Memory databases press the <b>Selected</b> button,
            which will open the Translation Memory selection dialog.</li>
          <li>Translation Memory databases can also be deselected by double-clicking the Translation
            Memory name.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>If the folder is protected by a password, you can only change the fields on the
          <q>Admin </q> page if you know the password.</p>
      <parml>
        <plentry>
          <pt>Controlled folder handling</pt>
          <pd>If it is a folder for which controlled folder handling was selected during its
            creation, this check box is selected. For more information on this option, refer to
              <xref href="folder_Overview.dita#folder_Overview/cfh">Controlled folder
            handling</xref>.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>Password</pt>
          <pd>If the folder is protected by a password, type the password assigned to this
            folder.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>Project coordinator</pt>
          <pd>Contains the name and e-mail of the project coordinator. You can change the fields if
            you are the project coordinator or allowed to perform the tasks of the project
            coordinator.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>Originator</pt>
          <pd>If this folder has not been exported yet, the <b>Name</b> and the <b>e-mail</b> fields
            are empty. If this folder was exported before, the fields contain the name and e-mail
            address of the person who last exported it.</pd>
        </plentry>
        <plentry>
          <pt>Translator</pt>
          <pd>Select or specify name and e-mail address of the person to receive the folder
            next.</pd>
        </plentry>
      </parml>
      <p>The <q>Project Info</q> page contains information about the project. You can
        change all fields if you are the project coordinator. If the folder is protected by a
        password, you can only change them if you specified the correct password on the <q>Admin</q>
        page.</p>
      <p>If you change the shipment number or specify one for this folder for the first
        time, export and import again any documents that this folder already contains. This is
        necessary to get a correct Calculating, Preanalysis, or Redundancy Report (see <xref
          href="report_Chapter.dita#report_Chapter"/>). </p>
      <p>The "Admin" page contains also two buttons for the maintenance of the folder history log.
        The folder history log contains all information concerning the folder history and is vital
        for the creation of calculation reports.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The "Delete history log" button deletes the complete history log. No calculation reports
          can be performed for this folder anymore. Use this button only when an existing folder is
          re-used for another translation job or for another shipment and the counting information
          of the previous shipment is not required anymore.</li>
        <li>The "Clean history log" button tries to reduce the size of the history log by removing
          superfluos entries from the history log.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When the folder has an associated global memory option file the additional page <q>Global
          Memory</q> is available: <required-cleanup><indexterm>windows<indexterm>Folder Properties
              Global Memory</indexterm></indexterm></required-cleanup>

        </fig>
        Here you can review and modify the options for global memory
        proposals. The meta data file field shows the name of the associated global memory option
        file. In the global memory by project area the scrollable table with the project IDs and the
        settings is displayed. The table has the following columns:</p>

        </parml>The button "save meta data file" saves the global memory options and the button
        "Save meta data file and got to Analysis panel" saves the global memory option file, closes
        the folder property window and opens the Analysis window.</p>
      <p>To save the changes of the properties, click <b>Change</b>.</p>

      <p>If you select <b>Change</b>, the folder properties are changed according to your
        specifications. Otherwise, they remain unchanged. You are returned to the previous
        window.</p>
      <p>If you entered the name of new <keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/xlmem"/>, the 
        <b>New <keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/xlmem"/></b> is displayed
        to specify the characteristics of this <keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/xlmem"/>.</p>
      <p>If you changed a markup table name, it is strongly recommended that you analyze the
