    <p>The Shared Translation Memory concept, that uses <keyword conref="common-symbols.dita#common-symbols/tm4w"/> 
       as the WEB-based translation memory did not meet the expectations. So we decided to re-design this solution, 
       now being fully based on own code.</p>
    <p>The solution is based on a server component, that is mainly represented by MariaDB.</p>
    <p>Since we still need to do some updates on this solution, we provide the solution <q>as is</q>, but encourage
       testers to perform some tests. The documentation is not fully authored in DITA, so we ask the test team members
       to use the document <q>Shared_Translation_Memory_UsersGuide.pdf</q> provided to the test teams.</p>
    <p>See also the information on page <xref href="memory_SharedWeb.dita#memory_SharedWeb"/></p>
